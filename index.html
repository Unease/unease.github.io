    <p>Hi, I'm Unease and you may also know me as ItsUnease and formerly as UneasePurse37.<br>
        Although I don't like being referred to as the latter, I use as a handle as shown on my
        several of my social media accounts. <br>
        I'm currently interested in coding lanuages such as Java and the various subsets of C.<br>
    I'm also interested in Tool-Assisted Speedruns in many games and create TASes myself for Minecraft.<br>
My favorite games are Majora's Mask and Super Mario Galaxy, although I also enjoy
other platformers <br> and puzzle games like Picross and Tetris.</p>
